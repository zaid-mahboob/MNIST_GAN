# GAN for MNIST Number Generation
This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on the MNIST dataset for generating images of handwritten numbers. The GAN model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow, and the training process and results can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook file.
## What are GANs?
GANs, or Generative Adversarial Networks, are a class of machine learning models used for generative tasks such as image synthesis. They consist of two main components: a generator and a discriminator, both of which are neural networks.

The generator is responsible for creating synthetic data, in this case, images of handwritten numbers. It takes random noise as input and learns to transform it into realistic-looking images. The goal of the generator is to generate data that is similar enough to real data (in this case, real MNIST images) to fool the discriminator.

The discriminator is a binary classifier that learns to distinguish between real images and the synthetic images generated by the generator. It takes an input image and outputs a probability score, indicating whether the image is real or fake. The discriminator is trained on a combination of real MNIST images and the synthetic images generated by the generator.

The training process involves a competitive interplay between the generator and the discriminator. The generator tries to produce images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real images, while the discriminator learns to improve its ability to differentiate between real and synthetic images. Over time, this adversarial training leads to the generator generating increasingly realistic images.
## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is widely used in the machine learning community and serves as a good starting point for training image-based models.
